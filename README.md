Summary for mada (Mathematik f√ºr die Datenkommunikation) at FHNW.

Files are written with the Mac-Tool ["Archimedes"][1] which combines Markdown and LaTeX.

There might be other tools that can work with these files. If you find such a tool or a workflow that you like, please share it over this repository!

As the output from Archimedes is several pages long and I have no idea how to resize images in Markdown, I found that the best practice for me is to throw the output-pdf into InDesign and assemble a nice summary to use in exams.
